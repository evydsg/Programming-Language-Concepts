# Matrix Multiplication with Counting Loop vs. Logical Loop
This repository contains two implementations of matrix multiplication in Java, one using counting loop constructs and the other using only logical loops (e.g., while loops). The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the differences between these two approaches and help you understand the value of counting loops in certain scenarios.

## Background
Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in linear algebra and various applications, including computer graphics, machine learning, and scientific computing. When implementing matrix multiplication in a programming language, you can choose different loop constructs to iterate over the matrix elements, which can significantly impact performance and readability.
